                        <div class="row abstract">

                                    Abstract: The most important unsolved problem with artificial neural networks is how
                                    to do unsupervised learning as effectively as the brain. There are currently two
                                    main
                                    approaches to unsupervised learning. In the first approach, exemplified by BERT and
                                    Variational Autoencoders, a deep neural network is used to reconstruct its input.
                                    This is problematic for images
                                    because the deepest layers of the network need to encode the fine details of the
                                    image. An alternative approach, introduced by
                                    Becker and Hinton in 1992, is to train two copies of a deep neural network to
                                    produce output vectors that have
                                    high mutual information when given two different crops of the same image as their
                                    inputs. This approach was designed to allow the representations to be untethered
                                    from irrelevant details
                                    of the input.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The method of optimizing mutual information used by Becker and Hinton was flawed
                                    (for a subtle reason that I will explain) so
                                    Pacannaro and Hinton replaced it by a discriminative objective in which one vector
                                    representation must select a corresponding
                                    vector representation from among many alternatives. With faster hardware,
                                    contrastive learning of representations has recently become very popular
                                    and is proving to be very effective, but it suffers from a major flaw: To learn
                                    pairs of representation vectors that
                                    have N bits of mutual information we need to contrast the correct corresponding
                                    vector with about 2 N incorrect alternatives. I will
                                    describe a novel and effective way of dealing with this limitation. I will also show
                                    that this leads to a simple way of implementing
                                    perceptual learning in cortex.

                                    Machine learning (ML) has been run and applied by premising a
                                    series of presuppositions, which contributes both the great success
                                    of AI and the bottleneck of further development of ML. These presuppositions include
                                    (i) the independence assumption of loss function on dataset (Hypothesis I); (ii) the
                                    large capacity assumption on
                                    hypothesis space including solution (Hypothesis II); (iii) the completeness
                                    assumption of training data with high quality (Hypothesis III); and (iv) the
                                    Euclidean assumption on analysis framework
                                    and methodology (Hypothesis IV).

                                    We report, in this presentation, the effort and advances made
                                    by my group on how to break through these presuppositions of
                                    ML and drive ML development. For Hypothesis I, we introduce the
                                    noise modeling principle to adaptively design the loss function of
                                    ML, according to the distribution of data samples, which provides
                                    then a general way to robustlize any ML implementation. For Hypothesis II, we
                                    propose the model driven deep learning approach to define the smallest hypothesis
                                    space of deep neural networks (DNN), which yields not only the very efficient deep
                                    learning, but also a novel way
                                    of DNN design, interpretation and connection with the traditional optimization based
                                    approach. For Hypothesis III, we develop the
                                    axiomatic curriculum learning framework to
                                    learn the patterns from an incomplete dataset step by step and from easy to
                                    difficult, which then provides feasible ways to tackle very
                                    complex incomplete data sets. Finally, For Hypothesis IV, we introduce Banach space
                                    geometry in general, and XU-Roach theorem in
                                    particular, as a possibly useful tool to conduct non-Euclidean analysis of ML
                                    problems. In each case, we present the idea, principles, application examples and
                                    literatures.

                                    Coopetitions are activities in which competitors cooperate for a common good 1 .
                                    Community evaluations such as the Text REtrieval
                                    Conference (TREC) are prototypical examples of coopetitions in information retrieval
                                    (IR) and have now been part of the field for
                                    almost thirty years. This longevity and the proliferation of shared evaluation tasks
                                    suggest that, indeed, the net impact of community
                                    evaluations is positive. But what are these benefits, and what are the attendant
                                    costs?
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    This talk will use TREC tracks as case studies to explore the benefits and
                                    disadvantages of different evaluation task designs. Coopetitions can improve
                                    state-of-the-art effectiveness for a retrieval task by establishing a research
                                    cohort and constructing the
                                    infrastructure–including problem definition, test collections, scoring metrics, and
                                    research methodology–necessary to make progress
                                    on the task. They can also facilitate technology transfer and amortize the
                                    infrastructure costs. The primary danger of coopetitions
                                    is for an entire research community to overfit to some peculiarity of the evaluation
                                    task. This risk can be minimized by building
                                    multiple test sets and regularly updating the evaluation task.

                                    The current fight against the COVID-19 pandemic illustrates the
                                    importance of proper scientific methods: Besides fake news lacking
                                    any factual evidence, reports on clinical trials with various drugs
                                    often yield contradicting results; here, only a closer look at the
                                    underlying empirical methodology can help in forming a clearer
                                    picture.

                                    In IR research, empirical foundation in the form of experiments
                                    plays an important role. However, the methods applied often are
                                    not at the level of scientific standards that hold in many other disciplines, as IR
                                    experiments are frequently flawed in several ways:
                                    Measures like MRR or ERR are invalid by definition, and MAP is
                                    based on unrealistic assumptions about user behaviour; computing
                                    relative improvements of arithmetic means is statistical nonsense;
                                    test hypotheses often are formulated after the experiment has been
                                    carried out; multiple hypotheses are tested without correction;
                                    many experiments are not reproducible results or are compared to
                                    weak baselines [1, 6]; frequent reuse of the same test collections
                                    yields random results [2]; authors (and reviewers) believe that experiments prove
                                    the claims made. Methods for overcoming these
                                    problems have been pointed out [5], but are still widely ignored.
                                </p>

                                <p>

                                    However, even when experimental results have been achieved
                                    via proper methods, this only solves the issue of internal validity.
                                    The problem of external validity has hardly been addressed in IR
                                    so far. Just having empirical results for a handful or test collections
                                    does not enable us to make any statements on how far we can
                                    generalise these observations. So we should put more emphasis on
                                    understanding why certain methods work (or don’t work) under
                                    certain circumstances - instead of looking at improvements at the
                                    third or fourth decimal place. This would allow us to make more
                                    generally valid statements, and be a first step towards being able to
                                    predict performance for new collections [3, 4].

                                    To conclude, better research in IR can only be achieved by
                                    • Enforcing rigorous experimental methodology at our top
                                    venues.
                                    • Establishing leaderboards and carrying out metastudies for
                                    monitoring the actual scientific progress in our field.
                                    • Understanding should be valued higher than raw performance.
                                    • Ultimately, research should aim more at performance prediction than at performance
                                    measurement.

                                    Information retrieval (IR) is the science of search, the search of
                                    user query relevant pieces of information from a collection of
                                    unstructured resources. Information in this context includes text,
                                    imagery, audio, video, xml, program, and metadata. The journey
                                    of an IR process begins with a user query sent to the IR system
                                    which encodes the query, compares the query with the available
                                    resources, and returns the most relevant pieces of information.
                                    Thus, the system is equipped with the ability to store, retrieve and
                                    maintain information.

                                    In the early era of IR, the whole process was completed using
                                    handcrafted features and ad-hoc relevance measures. Later,
                                    principled frameworks for relevance measure were developed with
                                    statistical learning as a basis. Recently, deep learning has proven
                                    essential to the introduction of more opportunities to IR. This is
                                    because data-driven features combined with data-driven relevance
                                    measures can effectively eliminate the human bias in either feature
                                    or relevance measure design.

                                    Deep learning has shown its significant potential to transform IR
                                    evidenced by abundant empirical results. However, we continue to
                                    strive to gain a comprehensive understanding of deep learning.
                                    This is done by answering questions such as why deep structures
                                    are superior to shallow structures, how skip connections affect a
                                    model’s performance, uncovering the potential relationship
                                    between some of the hyper-parameters and a model’s
                                    performance, and exploring ways to reduce the chance for deep
                                    models to be fooled by adversaries. Answering such questions can
                                    help design more effective deep models and devise more efficient
                                    schemes for model training.
